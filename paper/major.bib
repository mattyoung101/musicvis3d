    abstract = {Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) implementation requires high
                computational resources and time; a computational complexity of
                order O(N2) for a signal of size N. Fast Fourier transform (FFT)
                algorithm, that uses butterfly structures, has a computational
                complexity of O(Nlog(N)), a value much less than O(N2). However,
                in recent years by introducing big data in many applications, FFT
                calculations still impose serious challenges in terms of
                computational complexity, time requirement, and energy
                consumption. Involved data in many of these applications are
                sparse in the spectral domain. For these data by using Sparse
                Fast Fourier Transform (SFFT) algorithms with a sub-linear
                computational and sampling complexity, the problem of
                computational complexity of Fourier transform has been reduced
                substantially. Different algorithms and hardware implementations
                have been introduced and developed for SFFT calculations. This
                paper presents a categorized review of SFFT, highlights the
                differences of its various algorithms and implementations, and
                also reviews the current use of SFFT in different applications.},
